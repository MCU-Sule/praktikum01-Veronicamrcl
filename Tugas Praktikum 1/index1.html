      <h1 align=center>Why English Is So Hard <sup>&reg;</sup></h1><br>
      <hr>
       <p> <font face="consolas" size="4"> <b> We'll begin with a box, and the plural is boxes,<br>
        But the plural of ox becomes oxen, not oxes. <br>
        One fowl is a goose, but two are called geese, <br>
        Yet the plural moose should never be meese. <br>
        You may find a lone mouse or a nest full of mice, <br>
        Yet the plural of house is house, not hice. </font></b><br></p>

     <p><font face="consolas" size="3" > <b> <u> If</u> the plural of man is always called men, <br>
        Why shouldn't the pulral of pen be called pen? <br>
        <u> If</u> i speak of my foot and show you my feet, <br>
        And i give you a boot, would a pair be called beet? <br>
        <u> If</u> oe is a tooth and a whole set are teeth, <br>
        Why shouldn't the plural of booth be called beeth? </font></b><br></p>
     
     <p><font face="consolas" size="2">The one may be that, and there would be those, <br>
        Yet hat in that pulral would never be hose, <br>
        And the plural of cat is cats, not cose. <br>
        We speak of a brother and alson of brethern, <br>
        But tough we say mother, we never say methren. <br>
        Then the masculine pronouns are he, his, and him, <br>
        <i> <s> But imagine the feminine: she, shis and shim! </font></p></s></i>
